RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is an advanced AI technique that combines information retrieval with text generation to produce more accurate and contextually relevant responses. Instead of relying only on the modelâ€™s pre-trained knowledge, RAG first retrieves relevant documents or facts from an external knowledge base (like a database or search index) and then uses a language model to generate an answer based on both the retrieved information and its own reasoning. This approach reduces hallucinations, keeps responses up-to-date, and allows AI systems to handle tasks that require domain-specific or constantly changing knowledge.
